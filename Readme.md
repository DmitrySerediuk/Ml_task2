**Task 1 (1 point).** Built a histogram of the height distribution in meters from footbal player data. Remember that height is in format feet 'inches. Instead of filling null values with some constant just drop them. Use .dropna for specified column.
**Done(1/1)**

**Task 2 (0.5 point).** Write your own function for MSE calculation using the formula above. Calculate train and test MSE, compare to built-in method (sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error)
**Done(0.5/0.5)**

**Task 3 (1.5 points).** Visualize the dependence of test BallControl predictions and real BallControl score on Dribbling score. Don't forget to add axis and plot names!
**Done(1.5/1.5)**

**Task 4 (5 points).** Implement your own Linear Regression class for any number of input features and settable boolean parameter *fit_intercept*.
**Done(5/5)**

**Task 5 (up to 5 points).** Build a Linear Regression model for _Value_ prediction for every football player and validate it. You **have to** use either your custom Linear Regression class or `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` with regularization param alpha=0. Steps you need to follow:
- Extract float number from _Value_ field in DataFrame (**0.5 points**)

- Ð¡hoose more features that you expect to influence on player _Value_ (at least 10)
- Plot feature correlation matrix. (**0.5 points**)
- Drop features that are highly correlated with each other (_abs_(corr) > 0.9) one by one until no correlated pairs left. _Hint_: you may reuse code from Task_9 in HW_1 for automatic correlated pairs selection. (**1.5 points**)
- Split data into train/test with some proportion (**0.5 points**)
- Train a model on train dataset, make predictions both for train and test. (**0.5 points**)
- Measure the model quality in terms of MSE in train and test samples,  (**0.5 points**)
- Write a short report about the work done. Why did you take these particular features? Can you find a logical explanation for high correlation of some of your features? Are you satisfied with the quality of predictions? etc. (**1 point**)

**All Done(5/5)**


**Penalties**
- **-1 point** if used a different model besides custom Linear Regression or `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` with regularization param alpha=0
- **-0.5 points** if number of selected features BEFORE removal of linearly dependent ones is less than 10.
- **-0.5 points** if did not remove linearly dependent features before training the model.

**Done(0/-2)**

**Total: 13/13**
